# ArduinoLightingControl

My purpose was control the light via bluetooth or wi-fi with Arduino, but I wasn't have any shield so I followed a tricky way. I used serial port.

This project have 4 parts.

1) Arduino code for reading serial port and trigger relay module. 

2) Android project, speech recognition and push data to server 

3) 2 php page, one of write to txt, one of read from txt

4) A java program, can control the light manually with buttons. (Send data to via serial port)  Another button for start listening to server and the getting the last value from server .
